# Enhanced Live Preview v2.0 - Removed

## Notice

The Enhanced Live Preview System v2.0 and all associated test files have been intentionally removed from this codebase for cleanliness and maintainability.

### What was removed:
- Enhanced Live Preview System v2.0 functionality
- All related JavaScript functions and initialization code
- PREVIEW_CONFIG object and configuration system
- Real-time WYSIWYG preview capabilities
- Enhanced v2.0 status indicators and UI components
- Test files: test-preview.html, test-preview-config.html, test-results.html

### What was preserved:
- Basic container structure for future implementation
- Container styling and layout
- Integration points for future extensibility
- Core customizer functionality (configuration management)

### Rationale:
This removal ensures:
- ✅ Cleaner, more maintainable codebase
- ✅ Reduced complexity and potential bugs
- ✅ Foundation preserved for future enhancements
- ✅ Better separation of concerns

The customizer continues to function for configuration management without the Enhanced v2.0 live preview capabilities.
