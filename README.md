The canvas shadow color setting has been unified to use canonical naming:
- **Current (canonical):** `canvas_shadow_color` - used in all internal plugin logic
- **Legacy (deprecated):** `ai_canvas_shadow_color` - WordPress Customizer theme_mod key

**Backward Compatibility:**
- Existing installations automatically migrate legacy settings
- Legacy `ai_canvas_shadow_color` values are preserved during migration
- CSS variables updated to `--aiw-canvas-shadow-color` with `--aiw-shadow-color` alias
- Deprecation notices logged in debug mode when legacy keys detected

**For Developers:**
- Use `canvas_shadow_color` for all new integrations
- Helper function `get_canvas_shadow_color()` handles fallback logic
- Legacy support maintained for one release cycle
